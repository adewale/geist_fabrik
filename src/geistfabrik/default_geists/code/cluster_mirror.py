"""Cluster Mirror geist - reveals semantic vault structure.

Shows automatically-named clusters with representative samples, then asks:
"What do these clusters remind you of?"

Pure pattern presentation without interpretation - a mirror that reflects
the unconscious organizational structure of your vault back to you.
