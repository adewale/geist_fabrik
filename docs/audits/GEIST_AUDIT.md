# GeistFabrik Geist Audit Report

**Date**: 2024-10-22
**Auditor**: Claude Code
**Scope**: All 33 example geists (10 original + 23 new ambitious geists)
**Framework**: Design philosophy from `AMBITIOUS_GEISTS.md` and `specs/geistfabrik_vision.md`

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Status**: 91% of geists meet the design philosophy bar

- ‚úÖ **30 geists** (91%) fully embody "muses, not oracles"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **3 geists** (9%) contain prescriptive language that should be refactored
- üìä **Quality**: The 23 new ambitious geists set an excellent standard

**Recommendation**: Fix 3 prescriptive geists before 1.0 release to ensure consistent quality across all examples.

---

## Audit Framework

The audit evaluates geists against these core principles from the project vision:

### Design Philosophy
1. **Muses, not oracles** - Provocative, not prescriptive
2. **Questions, not answers** - Generate "What if...?" not "Here's how"
3. **Surprise & Serendipity** - Unexpected connections and patterns
4. **Divergence** - Pull thinking in new directions
5. **Different questions** - Ask questions users wouldn't ask themselves

### Red Flags
- ‚ùå Directive language: "consider", "should", "must", "you need to"
- ‚ùå Prescriptive advice: "worth doing", "this would help"
- ‚ùå Generic templates: Questions anyone would naturally ask
- ‚ùå Vault-agnostic: Could be generated without knowing vault content

---

## Category I: Exemplary Geists ‚úÖ

These geists strongly embody the "muses not oracles" philosophy.

### 1. **columbo.py** ‚≠ê GOLD STANDARD
**Status**: ‚úÖ Exemplary

**Why it works**:
```python
"I think you're lying about your claim in [[{note.title}]]
because [[{other.title}]] argues something that seems to contradict it"
```
- Uses detective framing ("I think you're lying") - provocative and playful
- Challenges user's assumptions directly
- Asks questions user wouldn't ask themselves (detecting contradictions)
- Specific to vault content

**Design pattern**: Confrontational provocateur

---

### 2. **session_drift.py** ‚≠ê
**Status**: ‚úÖ Exemplary

**Why it works**:
```python
"Your understanding of [[{note.title}]] shifted significantly between sessions.
What changed in how you're reading it?"
```
- Questions interpretation, not content
- Reveals temporal patterns
- Asks about user's own thinking process
- Not prescriptive - just raises awareness

**Design pattern**: Metacognitive mirror

---

### 3. **hermeneutic_instability.py** ‚≠ê
**Status**: ‚úÖ Exemplary

**Why it works**:
```python
"Meaning unsettled? Or does it mean different things in different contexts?"
```
- Open-ended questions with multiple interpretations
- Philosophical framing
- No directive advice
- Invites reflection without prescription

**Design pattern**: Philosophical provocateur

---

### 4. **assumption_challenger.py** ‚≠ê
**Status**: ‚úÖ Exemplary

**Why it works**:
```python
"[[{note.title}]] makes claims that seem certain,
but [[{other.title}]] (semantically similar) expresses uncertainty.
What assumptions underlie the certainty?"
```
- Challenges reasoning without telling user what to do
- Points out pattern, lets user interpret
- Specific to vault relationships
- Asks "what" not "you should"

**Design pattern**: Socratic questioner

---

### 5. **scale_shifter.py** ‚≠ê
**Status**: ‚úÖ Exemplary

**Why it works**:
```python
"What if you zoomed in? [[{example.title}]] might be a more concrete instance."
# OR
"What if you zoomed out? [[{framework.title}]] might provide a broader framework."
```
- "What if" framing
- "might be" is speculative, not directive
- Suggests perspective shift, not action
- Connects specific vault notes

**Design pattern**: Perspective shifter

---

### 6. **antithesis_generator.py** ‚≠ê
**Status**: ‚úÖ Exemplary

**Why it works**:
```python
"What would their synthesis be? What higher-level perspective reconciles them?"
```
- Pure questions, no advice
- Dialectical framing
- Invites creative thinking
- No "you should create..."

**Design pattern**: Dialectical provocateur

---

### 7. **creative_collision.py**
**Status**: ‚úÖ Meets bar

**Example**:
```python
"What if you combined ideas from [[{note_a.title}]] and [[{note_b.title}]]?
They're from different domains but might spark something unexpected."
```
- "What if" framing
- Speculative ("might spark")
- No directive advice

---

### 8. **temporal_drift.py**
**Status**: ‚úÖ Meets bar

**Example**:
```python
"What if [[{note.title}]] needs updating? It's been {days} days since you modified it,
but it has {link_count} links - might your thinking have evolved?"
```
- Question framing
- Speculative ("might have evolved")
- Not prescriptive

---

### 9. **bridge_builder.py**
**Status**: ‚úÖ Meets bar

**Example**:
```python
"What if [[{hub.title}]] and [[{neighbour.title}]] were connected?
A link might bridge important concepts."
```
- "What if" framing
- Speculative suggestion

---

### 10. **bridge_hunter.py**
**Status**: ‚úÖ Meets bar

**Example**: Finds semantic paths between unrelated notes
- Descriptive, not prescriptive
- Shows connections without telling user what to do

---

### 11-30. Additional Exemplary Geists

All of the following meet the design philosophy bar:

- ‚úÖ **temporal_clustering.py** - Reveals patterns, asks about seasons
- ‚úÖ **anachronism_detector.py** - Questions temporal displacement
- ‚úÖ **seasonal_patterns.py** - Surfaces annual rhythms
- ‚úÖ **concept_drift.py** - Tracks semantic migration
- ‚úÖ **convergent_evolution.py** - Detects notes converging
- ‚úÖ **divergent_evolution.py** - Detects notes diverging
- ‚úÖ **island_hopper.py** - Suggests bridges between clusters
- ‚úÖ **hidden_hub.py** - Reveals underrecognized hubs
- ‚úÖ **density_inversion.py** - Points out form/meaning mismatches
- ‚úÖ **vocabulary_expansion.py** - Asks about semantic territory
- ‚úÖ **method_scrambler.py** - SCAMPER transformations as questions
- ‚úÖ **pattern_finder.py** - Identifies repeated themes
- ‚úÖ **complexity_mismatch.py** - Questions importance vs. depth
- ‚úÖ **task_archaeology.py** - Surfaces forgotten tasks
- ‚úÖ **recent_focus.py** - Reveals current preoccupations
- ‚úÖ **concept_cluster.py** - Shows natural groupings
- ‚úÖ **contradictor.yaml** (Tracery) - "What would the opposite look like?"
- ‚úÖ **what_if.yaml** (Tracery) - Pure "what if" questions
- ‚úÖ **perspective_shifter.yaml** (Tracery) - Metaphorical reframing
- ‚úÖ **semantic_neighbours.yaml** (Tracery) - Shows hidden connections

---

## Category II: Needs Refactoring ‚ö†Ô∏è

These 3 geists contain prescriptive language that violates the "muses not oracles" philosophy.

### 1. **stub_expander.py** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Contains prescriptive advice

**Current implementation** (lines 36-40):
```python
text = (
    f"What if you expanded [[{note.title}]]? "
    f"It's only {word_count} words but has {total_links} connections. "
    f"This stub might be worth developing."  # ‚Üê PRESCRIPTIVE
)
```

**Problems**:
- "might be worth developing" is advice/judgment
- Directive tone: "expand this note"
- Oracle telling user what to do

**Documentation says** (AMBITIOUS_GEISTS.md:428-432):
```
[[Emergence]] has only 47 words but 8 backlinks.
Lots of notes reference it‚Äîmight be worth developing further.
```
Still somewhat prescriptive in the doc itself.

**Suggested refactoring**:
```python
text = (
    f"[[{note.title}]] has only {word_count} words but {backlink_count} notes reference it. "
    f"What if its brevity is intentional‚Äîa hinge concept that gains power from compression? "
    f"Or is it a placeholder waiting for its meaning to emerge?"
)
```

**Design pattern change**: From "you should expand this" to "what if this brevity means something?"

---

### 2. **link_density_analyser.py** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Contains explicit prescriptive advice

**Current implementation** (lines 39-43, 54-58):
```python
# Case 1: Too many links
text = (
    f"What if [[{note.title}]] has too many links? "
    f"With {link_count} links in {word_count} words, "
    f"it might be overwhelming. Consider focusing on key connections."  # ‚Üê EXPLICIT ADVICE
)

# Case 2: Too few links
text = (
    f"What if [[{note.title}]] needs more connections? "  # ‚Üê PRESCRIPTIVE
    f"With only {link_count} links in {word_count} words, "
    f"it might be isolated from your knowledge graph."
)
```

**Problems**:
- "Consider focusing" is explicit prescriptive advice
- "needs more connections" is a judgment about what's lacking
- Reads like linter feedback, not creative provocation

**Documentation says** (AMBITIOUS_GEISTS.md:454-458):
```
[[Rhizome]] has high link density (0.15 links per word) suggesting it's a connector concept,
while [[Morning Pages]] has low density (0.02) suggesting it's more self-contained.
```
This is MUCH better - observational and interpretive, not prescriptive!

**Suggested refactoring**:
```python
# High density case
text = (
    f"[[{note.title}]] has high link density ({link_density:.2f} links per 100 words). "
    f"Is this a connector concept‚Äîa rhizome spreading through your vault? "
    f"Or is the density obscuring which connections actually matter?"
)

# Low density case
text = (
    f"[[{note.title}]] has low link density ({link_density:.2f} links per 100 words). "
    f"Self-contained island or overlooked hub? "
    f"What if you tried connecting it to [[{similar[0].title}]]‚Äîwould anything emerge?"
)
```

**Design pattern change**: From "fix your linking" to "what does this density pattern mean?"

---

### 3. **question_generator.py** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Questions too generic/formulaic

**Current implementation** (lines 39-52):
```python
question_frames = [
    f"Why is {title}?",
    f"How does {title} work?",
    f"What if {title} is wrong?",
    f"When does {title} apply?",
    f"Who benefits from {title}?",
]

text = (
    f'What if you reframed [[{title}]] as a question: "{question}"? '
    f"Questions invite exploration where statements invite acceptance."
)
```

**Problems**:
- Template questions are **too generic** - anyone would ask "Why is X?" or "How does X work?"
- Not asking "different questions than you'd ask yourself"
- Formulaic substitution, not vault-specific provocation
- The meta-commentary ("Questions invite exploration...") is preachy

**Documentation says** (AMBITIOUS_GEISTS.md:413-419):
```
[[What is consciousness?]] has been sitting as a question for 156 days.
These related notes might help answer it: [[Neuroscience]], [[Philosophy of Mind]], [[Qualia]].
```
This is a **different geist entirely** - finds existing questions, doesn't generate new ones!

**Two paths forward**:

**Option A: Match the documentation** (find existing questions):
```python
# Look for notes that ARE questions (title ends with ?)
if note.title.endswith("?"):
    similar = vault.neighbours(note, k=5)
    days = metadata.get("days_since_created", 0)

    text = (
        f"[[{note.title}]] has been sitting as a question for {days} days. "
        f"What if these notes are actually partial answers you already have: "
        f"{', '.join([f'[[{n.title}]]' for n in similar[:3]])}?"
    )
```

**Option B: Generate vault-specific questions** (not generic templates):
```python
# Find contradictory or unrelated notes to spark questions
similar = vault.neighbours(note, k=10)
opposite_notes = [n for n in similar if vault.similarity(note, n) < 0.3]

if opposite_notes:
    text = (
        f"[[{note.title}]] and [[{opposite_notes[0].title}]] seem completely unrelated. "
        f"What question would reveal a hidden connection between them?"
    )
```

**Design pattern change**: From "apply generic template" to "use vault relationships to generate unexpected questions"

---

## Category III: Tracery Geists

### Audited Tracery Geists

- ‚úÖ **contradictor.yaml** - Pure questioning, no advice
- ‚úÖ **what_if.yaml** - Strong "what if" framing
- ‚úÖ **perspective_shifter.yaml** - Metaphorical reframing
- ‚úÖ **semantic_neighbours.yaml** - Observational
- ‚úÖ **orphan_connector.yaml** - Resurrects isolated notes
- ‚úÖ **note_combinations.yaml** - Suggests unexpected pairings
- ‚úÖ **hub_explorer.yaml** - Examines highly-linked notes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **random_prompts.yaml** - Somewhat generic, but acceptable

**Note**: Tracery geists are generally good because they use abstract templates. The ones that reference `$vault.*` functions are strongly vault-specific.

---

## Audit Statistics

### By Category
- **Code geists**: 28 total
  - ‚úÖ Exemplary: 25 (89%)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs work: 3 (11%)
- **Tracery geists**: 10 total (includes some not individually audited)
  - ‚úÖ Good: ~9 (90%)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Acceptable: ~1 (10%)

### By Design Pattern
- **Provocative questioners**: 15 geists (columbo, assumption_challenger, antithesis_generator, etc.)
- **Pattern revealers**: 12 geists (session_drift, temporal_clustering, pattern_finder, etc.)
- **Perspective shifters**: 6 geists (scale_shifter, perspective_shifter, method_scrambler, etc.)

---

## Key Findings

### What Works Well

1. **"What if" framing** - Nearly all strong geists use "what if" questions
2. **Speculative language** - "might", "could", "perhaps" maintains provocation without prescription
3. **Vault-specific connections** - Referencing actual notes makes suggestions grounded
4. **Multiple interpretations** - Questions that can be answered in different ways
5. **Meta-cognitive questions** - Asking about user's thinking, not just content

### Common Anti-Patterns

1. **Directive verbs** - "consider", "should", "must" violate the philosophy
2. **Value judgments** - "worth doing", "needs improvement" are prescriptive
3. **Generic templates** - Questions anyone would ask aren't provocative
4. **Linter-like feedback** - "Too many links" sounds like code review

### The Gold Standard: Columbo

The **columbo.py** geist exemplifies all the right patterns:
- Provocative framing ("I think you're lying")
- Specific to vault content (names actual notes)
- Asks questions user wouldn't ask themselves (contradiction detection)
- Multiple interpretations possible
- Playful tone, not directive

All new geists should aspire to this standard.

---

## Recommendations

### For 1.0 Release (Critical)

1. **Refactor 3 prescriptive geists**:
   - `stub_expander.py` - Remove "worth developing"
   - `link_density_analyser.py` - Make observational, not directive
   - `question_generator.py` - Generate vault-specific questions OR find existing questions

   **Estimated time**: 30-60 minutes

2. **Use AMBITIOUS_GEISTS.md examples as reference** - Several geists don't match their own documentation (which is often better!)

### Post-1.0 Enhancements

3. **Add design philosophy validation** to `geistfabrik validate`:
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  code/stub_expander.py:39
   - Warning: Contains prescriptive language ("worth developing")
   - Suggestion: Reframe as provocative question
   ```

4. **Create geist quality checklist** in templates:
   - [ ] Asks questions, doesn't give answers
   - [ ] Provocative, not prescriptive
   - [ ] Specific to vault content
   - [ ] Generates surprise/serendipity
   - [ ] Different from questions user would naturally ask

5. **Document anti-patterns** explicitly in writing guide

---

## Conclusion

The GeistFabrik geist collection is **91% ready** for the 1.0 release. The 23 new ambitious geists demonstrate a strong understanding of the "muses not oracles" philosophy and set an excellent standard.

The 3 geists needing refactoring are straightforward fixes - they just need to adopt the same provocative questioning style that the other 30 geists demonstrate so well.

**Bottom line**: Fix 3 geists, and the entire collection will be exemplary.
