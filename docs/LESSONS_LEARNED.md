## Architecture & Design

### ✅ Layered Architecture Works Brilliantly

**Decision**: Two-layer architecture (Vault → VaultContext)

**Why It Worked**:
- **Vault** (raw data): Simple, focused on I/O and parsing
- **VaultContext** (intelligence): Rich execution context with utilities, metadata, functions
- Clean separation of concerns
- Geists work with high-level abstractions, not raw data

**Lesson**: Put intelligence in the context layer, not the data layer. Keep data structures lightweight and immutable.

```python
# ❌ BAD: Intelligence in data layer
class Note:
    def get_similar_notes(self):  # Requires embeddings, DB access
    def get_complexity(self):     # Requires analysis

# ✅ GOOD: Intelligence in context layer
class VaultContext:
    def neighbours(self, note):    # Has access to embeddings, DB
    def metadata(self, note):     # Runs all inference modules
```

---

### ✅ Three-Dimensional Extensibility

**Decision**: Three extension points (Metadata, Functions, Geists)

**Why It Worked**:
- Users can extend at any level without modifying core
- Each dimension builds on the previous:
  1. **Metadata Inference**: Compute properties (complexity, sentiment)
  2. **Vault Functions**: Make metadata accessible to queries
  3. **Geists**: Use functions to generate suggestions

**Critical Insight**: Vault functions are the **bridge** between metadata and Tracery grammars.

**Lesson**: Design extensibility layers that compose. Each layer should have a clear interface and purpose.

---

### ✅ Temporal Embeddings = Game Changer

**Decision**: Compute fresh embeddings each session, store in `session_embeddings` table

**Why It's Powerful**:
- Tracks **how understanding evolves** over time
- Enables geists like Session Drift, Hermeneutic Instability, Convergent Evolution
- Detects semantic drift even when note content doesn't change
- Discovers temporal patterns (intellectual seasons, rhythms)

**Storage Cost**: ~1.5KB per note per session (~30MB for 1000 notes × 20 sessions)

**Lesson**: Don't just store final state—store the **history** of derived data. Temporal dimensions unlock entirely new classes of insights.

---

### ✅ Deterministic Randomness

**Decision**: Seed RNG with session date

**Why It Works**:
- Same vault state + same date = same suggestions
- Enables replay: `geistfabrik invoke --date 2025-01-15`
- Makes debugging possible
- Sessions are idempotent

**Lesson**: Make "random" systems deterministic for debugging and reproducibility. Users appreciate predictable behavior.

---

### ⚠️ Don't Overload the Note Class

**Mistake We Avoided**: Early temptation to add properties to `Note` class

**Why We Resisted**:
- Notes are immutable data structures from vault files
- Metadata is **contextual** (depends on vault state, embeddings, other notes)
- Different contexts might analyse same notes differently

**Right Approach**: `vault.metadata(note)` runs inference modules, returns dict

**Lesson**: Keep data structures simple. Put derived/contextual data in the context layer, not the data layer.

---

## Testing Philosophy

### ✅ Unit vs Integration: Proper Separation

**Decision**: Separate `tests/unit/` (fast, mocked) from `tests/integration/` (slow, real deps)

**Why It Works**:
- Unit tests: <5s total, no network, no model downloads
- Integration tests: <60s, real ML model, marked `@pytest.mark.slow`
- CI runs unit tests only (`pytest -m "not slow"`)
- 90% unit, 10% integration = ideal test pyramid

**Key Insight**: Create a **SentenceTransformerStub** that generates deterministic embeddings from text hashes

**Lesson**: Don't make unit tests download 80MB ML models. Stub expensive dependencies, test logic separately.

---

### ✅ Three-Layer Mocking Architecture

**Decision**: Defense-in-depth approach to prevent accidental model downloads

**Layers**:
1. **pytest_configure hook**: Patches `sentence_transformers` module globally
2. **EmbeddingComputer patching**: Patches `__init__` and `model` property
3. **Test-level mocks**: `mock_sentence_transformer` fixture

**Why It Works**:
- No test can accidentally download model (even if developer forgets to mock)
- Fast (~1000x faster than real model)
- Deterministic (hash-based embeddings)

**Lesson**: For expensive dependencies, use multiple layers of mocking to prevent accidents.

---

### ✅ Deterministic Stub Implementation

**Decision**: Generate embeddings from text content hash, normalize to unit vector

```python
def encode(self, text):
    # Generate deterministic embedding from text hash
    text_hash = hashlib.sha256(text.encode()).digest()
    # ... convert to 384-dim vector, normalize
```

**Why It's Brilliant**:
- Same text always produces same embedding
- Embeddings are **semantically meaningless** but **structurally valid**
- Tests verify logic, not ML model quality
- No variance between test runs

**Lesson**: Stubs should be deterministic and maintain structural invariants (shape, normalization) without semantic meaning.

---

### ⚠️ Module-Scoped Fixtures Can Hang CI

**Mistake**: Initially used `@pytest.fixture(scope="module")` for shared embedding computer

**Problem**: Fixture setup tried to download model before tests ran → 6+ minute hang in CI

**Solution**: Changed to `scope="function"` and used stub

**Lesson**: Module/session-scoped fixtures are dangerous with expensive initialization. Keep them lightweight or use stubs.

---

### ✅ Timeout Everything

**Decision**: Add `pytest.mark.timeout()` to ALL tests

```python
# Unit tests: 5s timeout
pytestmark = pytest.mark.timeout(5)

# Integration tests: 60s timeout
pytestmark = [
    pytest.mark.slow,
    pytest.mark.integration,
    pytest.mark.timeout(60),
]
```

**Why It Works**:
- Tests can't hang indefinitely
- CI fails fast instead of timing out after 6 hours
- Catches performance regressions

**Lesson**: Always set timeouts. Tests should fail fast, not hang forever.

---

### ✅ Test What Matters, Not Implementation

**Good Test** (tests behavior):
```python
def test_compute_semantic_embedding_mock(mock_computer):
    embedding = mock_computer.compute_semantic("test")
    assert embedding.shape == (384,)  # Verify shape
    assert np.linalg.norm(embedding) == pytest.approx(1.0)  # Verify normalization
```

**Bad Test** (tests implementation):
```python
def test_compute_semantic_embedding():
    assert computer._model.encode.called_with("test")  # Brittle!
```

**Lesson**: Test public interfaces and behavior, not internal implementation details.

---

## CI/CD & Automation

### ❌ Avoid Complex Verification Scripts in CI

**Mistake**: Created `check_phase_completion.py` that runs 100+ shell commands to verify acceptance criteria

**Problem**:
- Hung for 6+ minutes in CI
- Made all CI builds fail with exit 143 (SIGTERM)
- Wasn't critical for validating code quality

**Solution**: Removed from CI workflow

**Better Approach**:
```yaml
# Run critical checks only
- name: Run tests
  run: pytest -m "not slow"
- name: Run linting
  run: ruff check src/ tests/
- name: Run type checking
  run: mypy src/ --strict
```

**Lesson**: CI should run **fast, essential checks**. Move comprehensive audits to manual/scheduled jobs.

---

### ✅ Stub Expensive Dependencies in CI

**Decision**: Don't download HuggingFace model in CI

**Initial Approach** (FAILED):
```yaml
- name: Pre-download model
  run: python -c "from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer; ..."
  timeout-minutes: 5
```
- Tried to download before pytest activated stub
- Caused SIGTERM errors

**Final Approach** (SUCCESS):
```yaml
# Just run tests - stub handles everything
- name: Run tests
  run: pytest -m "not slow"
```

**Lesson**: Don't try to pre-download expensive deps in CI. Use stubs that eliminate the need entirely.

---

### ✅ Git LFS for Large Model Files

**Decision**: Support bundling the ML model with the repository

**Approach**:
- Download script: `python scripts/download_model.py`
- Git LFS for `.bin` and `.safetensors` files
- Code checks local path first, falls back to HuggingFace

**Benefits**:
- Offline usage (no internet required)
- Faster startup (no download wait)
- Reproducible (guaranteed model version)
- Privacy-friendly (no external API calls)

**Lesson**: For ML projects, provide option to bundle models locally. Git LFS makes this practical.

---

### ✅ Fail-Fast Matrix Strategy

**Decision**: Use `fail-fast: false` in CI matrix

```yaml
strategy:
  fail-fast: false
  matrix:
    os: [ubuntu-latest]
    python-version: ["3.11", "3.12"]
    include:
      - os: macos-latest
      - os: windows-latest
```

**Why**: Lets all jobs run even if one fails → better diagnostics

**Lesson**: In CI matrices, `fail-fast: false` gives you more information about what's broken.

---

## Performance & Optimization

### ✅ Semantic Embedding Cache

**Decision**: Cache embeddings by content hash in `embeddings` table

**Impact**:
- First session: 0% cache hit (cold start)
- Subsequent sessions: 90%+ cache hit for unchanged notes
- Saves 2-4 seconds per session
- Over 100 sessions: ~3-7 minutes saved

**Lesson**: Cache expensive computations. Hash-based invalidation is simple and effective.

---

### ✅ Batch Embeddings

**Decision**: Use batch encoding instead of one-at-a-time

**Impact**: 15-20x faster than naive implementation

```python
# ❌ BAD: One at a time
for note in notes:
    embedding = model.encode(note.content)

# ✅ GOOD: Batch
contents = [note.content for note in notes]
embeddings = model.encode(contents, batch_size=8)
```

**Lesson**: Always batch when calling ML models. The overhead of separate calls dominates for small inputs.

---

### ✅ Limit Thread Spawning

**Decision**: Set environment variables before importing ML libraries

```python
os.environ["OMP_NUM_THREADS"] = "1"
os.environ["MKL_NUM_THREADS"] = "1"
os.environ["TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM"] = "false"
```

**Why**: PyTorch spawns worker threads aggressively → process explosion in tests

**Lesson**: Control ML library parallelism explicitly, especially in test environments.

---

### ✅ Incremental Sync

**Decision**: Only reprocess changed files (check `file_mtime` in DB)

**Impact**: Sub-second sync for unchanged vaults

**Lesson**: Track modification times. Avoid reprocessing unchanged data.

---

### ✅ SQLite for Everything

**Decision**: Store notes, embeddings, sessions, metadata in SQLite

**Why It Works**:
- Fast queries (indexed)
- Portable (single file)
- Transactional (ACID)
- sqlite-vec extension for vector similarity
- No server required

**Lesson**: SQLite is underrated. It's perfect for local-first applications with rich query needs.

---

## Developer Experience

### ✅ Comprehensive Documentation

**Decision**: Write detailed README, tests/README, specs/, and docs/

**What Worked**:
- `tests/README.md`: Explains unit vs integration, how to run, how to add tests
- `docs/TEST_AUDIT.md`: Comprehensive audit of test structure
- `specs/`: Vision, spec, architecture, acceptance criteria
- `models/README.md`: Model bundling documentation

**Lesson**: Documentation pays dividends. Future contributors (including yourself) will thank you.

---

### ✅ Clear Error Messages

**Decision**: Provide actionable error messages with example commands

```python
# ❌ BAD
raise ValueError("Invalid geist")

# ✅ GOOD
raise ValueError(
    f"Geist '{geist_id}' failed after 3 attempts. "
    f"Test it with: geistfabrik test {geist_id} --date {date}"
)
```

**Lesson**: Error messages should tell users **exactly what to do** to fix the problem.

---

### ✅ uv for Dependency Management

**Decision**: Use `uv` instead of `pip` or `poetry`

**Why It's Great**:
- Fast (`uv sync` in seconds)
- Reliable (`uv.lock` is deterministic)
- Compatible with standard `pyproject.toml`
- Good caching

**Lesson**: Modern Python tooling (uv, ruff) is a huge DX improvement over traditional tools.

---

### ✅ Type Hints + mypy --strict

**Decision**: Use type hints everywhere, enforce with `mypy --strict`

**Benefits**:
- Catches bugs at write-time
- Serves as documentation
- Refactoring is safer
- IDE autocomplete works better

**Lesson**: `mypy --strict` is painful initially but prevents entire classes of bugs.

---

### ✅ Ruff for Linting

**Decision**: Use `ruff` instead of `flake8` + `black` + `isort`

**Why**:
- Fast (Rust-based)
- Single tool replaces 3+
- Auto-fixes most issues
- Good defaults

**Lesson**: Modern linters are fast enough to run on every save. Enable them.

---

## LLM-Assisted Development

### ✅ Specifications Before Code

**Decision**: Write comprehensive specs (`specs/geistfabrik_spec.md`, 1500+ lines) before implementation

**Why It Works**:
- LLM generates better code from detailed specs
- Acts as source of truth
- Prevents scope drift
- Enables incremental implementation

**Lesson**: LLMs need detailed specs to generate good code. Write specs first, then implement.

---

### ✅ Test-Driven Development with LLMs

**Decision**: Write acceptance criteria as runnable tests

**Why It Works**:
- LLM can verify its own work (`pytest` passes = feature complete)
- Prevents regressions
- Serves as living documentation

**Lesson**: Make acceptance criteria executable. LLMs can then self-verify.

---

### ⚠️ LLMs Create Dead Code

**Mistake**: LLM created `suggestions` and `suggestion_notes` tables that were never used

**How We Caught It**: Created `scripts/detect_unused_tables.py` to find SQL tables with no references

**Prevention**:
- Automated dead code detection
- Pre-commit hooks
- CI checks

**Lesson**: LLMs generate plausible-looking code that may not be used. Audit for dead code regularly.

---

### ⚠️ LLMs Don't Always Use Caches

**Mistake**: LLM created `embeddings` table but didn't use it → always recomputed embeddings

**How We Caught It**: Performance audit found all embeddings were recomputed every session

**Fix**: Updated `compute_embeddings()` to check cache first

**Lesson**: Verify that optimization code (caches, indexes) is **actually used**. LLMs often create infrastructure that goes unused.

---

### ✅ Comprehensive Audit Heuristics

**Decision**: Created `specs/python_audit_heuristics.md` (2,309 lines) documenting:
- LLM error patterns
- Python best practices
- Security concerns
- Testing anti-patterns

**Why It's Valuable**:
- Provides checklist for code review
- Helps LLMs avoid common mistakes
- Serves as project style guide

**Lesson**: Create a comprehensive audit document for your project. Use it to review LLM-generated code.

---

## Tool Selection

### ✅ sentence-transformers

**Why**:
- Offline embedding computation (no API calls)
- Good quality (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- Fast inference
- Open source

**Lesson**: Choose local-first ML libraries when possible. Users appreciate privacy and offline capability.

---

### ✅ sqlite-vec

**Why**:
- Vector similarity in SQLite
- No separate vector DB needed
- Fast enough for <10K notes
- Simple deployment

**Alternative Considered**: pgvector, Qdrant, Weaviate (all overkill for local app)

**Lesson**: Avoid adding infrastructure (vector DBs, Redis) when SQLite can handle it.

---

### ✅ pytest over unittest

**Why**:
- Simpler syntax
- Better fixtures
- Parameterization
- Rich plugin ecosystem (`pytest-timeout`, `pytest-cov`)

**Lesson**: pytest is the modern standard. Use it.

---

### ✅ uv over pip/poetry

**Why**:
- **Fast**: 10-100x faster than pip
- **Reliable**: Deterministic lockfiles
- **Compatible**: Uses standard `pyproject.toml`
- **Modern**: Still actively developed

**Lesson**: Try modern tools. They're often significantly better than established ones.

---

### ✅ Custom Tracery Implementation (Not pytracery)

**Decision**: Built our own Tracery-like engine (283 lines) instead of using `pytracery`

**Why**:
- **$vault.* function calls**: Our killer feature
  - Enables `$vault.sample_notes(3)` in Tracery grammars
  - Bridges declarative (Tracery) with imperative (VaultContext)
  - Would be awkward to add to pytracery's modifier system
- **Simplicity**: We only need subset of Tracery
  - Don't need modifiers (`.capitalize`, `.s`, `.ed`)
  - Don't need push-pop stack memory (`[variable:value]`)
  - 283 lines vs full library dependency
- **Integration**: Tight coupling with our types
  - Returns `Suggestion` objects
  - YAML format (not JSON)
  - Deterministic seeding

**What We Gave Up**:
- Standard Tracery modifiers
- Push-pop stack memory for variable reference
- Full Tracery spec compliance
- Community Tracery grammar compatibility

**What We Gained**:
- Vault integration (essential for our use case)
- Simpler, self-contained code
- No external dependency
- Exact fit to our needs

**Example**:
```yaml
tracery:
  origin: "What if [[#note1#]] and [[#note2#]] influenced each other?"
  note1: "$vault.sample_notes(1)"  # ← Custom feature!
  note2: "$vault.recent_notes(1)"
```

**Lesson**: When a library's core feature doesn't align with your needs, consider a focused custom implementation. We needed vault integration more than we needed modifiers.

**See**: `src/geistfabrik/tracery.py` module docstring for full feature comparison

---

## Common Pitfalls Avoided

### ❌ Don't Run Shell Commands in Tests

**Anti-pattern**:
```python
def test_cli():
    result = subprocess.run("geistfabrik invoke", shell=True)
    assert result.returncode == 0
```

**Problem**: Slow, brittle, hard to debug

**Better**:
```python
def test_invoke_command(temp_vault):
    from geistfabrik.cli import invoke
    result = invoke(temp_vault, date="2025-01-15")
    assert len(result.suggestions) > 0
```

**Lesson**: Test Python functions directly, not via shell commands.

---

### ❌ Don't Use `--all-extras` in CI

**Mistake**: Early CI used `pip install ".[all-extras]"`

**Problem**: Many projects don't define `all-extras`, or it includes unnecessary deps

**Better**: Be explicit about what you need

**Lesson**: Don't rely on generic extras. List dependencies explicitly.

---

### ❌ Don't Commit Generated Files

**Mistake**: Initially committed `geist journal/` files from test runs

**Problem**: Clutters repo, creates merge conflicts

**Fix**: Added to `.gitignore`

**Lesson**: Generated files (test outputs, caches) don't belong in git.

---

### ❌ Don't Trust LLM-Generated Comments

**Anti-pattern**:
```python
# This caches embeddings
table embeddings(...)  # Created but never used!
```

**Lesson**: Verify that code does what comments say. LLMs often generate aspirational comments.

---

## Best Practices Discovered

### ✅ Use Explicit Typing

```python
# ✅ GOOD: Explicit, clear
def neighbours(note: Note, k: int = 5) -> List[Tuple[Note, float]]:
    ...

# ❌ BAD: Implicit, unclear
def neighbours(note, k=5):
    ...
```

**Lesson**: Type hints are documentation + verification. Always use them.

---

### ✅ Dataclasses for Data Structures

```python
@dataclass
class Note:
    path: str
    title: str
    content: str
    links: List[Link]
    tags: List[str]
    created: datetime
    modified: datetime
```

**Why**: Immutable, type-checked, auto-generates `__init__`, `__repr__`, `__eq__`

**Lesson**: Use `@dataclass` for data structures. It's perfect for immutable value objects.

---

### ✅ Path as pathlib.Path

```python
# ✅ GOOD: Use Path
vault_path = Path(args.vault)
db_path = vault_path / "_geistfabrik" / "vault.db"

# ❌ BAD: String manipulation
db_path = args.vault + "/_geistfabrik/vault.db"
```

**Lesson**: `pathlib.Path` is better than string manipulation. Use it.

---

### ✅ Context Managers for Resources

```python
# ✅ GOOD: Automatic cleanup
@pytest.fixture
def test_db():
    db = init_db()
    yield db
    db.close()

# ❌ BAD: Manual cleanup (easy to forget)
@pytest.fixture
def test_db():
    db = init_db()
    return db  # Who closes it?
```

**Lesson**: Use context managers (`with`, `yield`) for resource cleanup. They guarantee cleanup even on exceptions.

---

### ✅ Generator Fixtures for Cleanup

**Pattern**:
```python
@pytest.fixture
def temp_vault(tmp_path):
    vault = tmp_path / "vault"
    vault.mkdir()
    yield vault
    # Cleanup happens automatically when tmp_path is cleaned up
```

**Lesson**: Generator fixtures (`yield`) are better than return fixtures for cleanup.

---

## What We'd Do Differently

### 🔄 Start with Test Infrastructure First

**What We Did**: Wrote code, then added tests

**Better Approach**: Set up test infrastructure (fixtures, stubs, CI) **first**, then TDD

**Why**: Would have avoided the "hanging test" crisis entirely

---

### 🔄 Create Shared Test Data Earlier

**What We Did**: Each test file created its own sample notes

**Better**: Create shared `sample_notes`, `sample_vault` fixtures early

**Why**: Reduces duplication, makes tests more consistent

---

### 🔄 Document as You Go

**What We Did**: Wrote most docs at the end

**Better**: Document each phase as it's completed

**Why**: Easier to remember design decisions while they're fresh

---

### 🔄 Separate "Expensive" from "Fast" Tests Earlier

**What We Did**: Mixed unit and integration tests initially, separated later

**Better**: Start with `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/` from day one

**Why**: Avoids needing to refactor test structure later

---

### 🔄 Use Coverage from the Start

**What We Did**: Added `pytest-cov` late in development

**Better**: Track coverage from first test

**Why**: Helps identify untested code paths early

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Architecture**: Layered architecture (data + context) scales beautifully
2. **Testing**: Proper unit/integration separation + stubs = fast, reliable tests
3. **CI/CD**: Keep CI fast and focused. Stub expensive dependencies.
4. **Performance**: Cache everything, batch ML operations, use SQLite
5. **DX**: Modern tools (uv, ruff, mypy) are worth adopting
6. **LLMs**: Write detailed specs first, audit generated code for dead code and unused optimizations
7. **Types**: `mypy --strict` prevents bugs. Always use type hints.
8. **Docs**: Write comprehensive docs. Future you will thank present you.
