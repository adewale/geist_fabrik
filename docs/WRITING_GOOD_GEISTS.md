# Writing Good Geists: A Practical Guide

**Purpose**: This guide helps you write geists that embody GeistFabrik's philosophy of "muses, not oracles."

---

## Core Philosophy

> "GeistFabrik is not an answer machine—it's a **question factory**."

Your geist should:
- ✅ **Ask questions**, not give answers
- ✅ **Provoke**, not prescribe
- ✅ **Surprise**, not predict
- ✅ **Diverge**, not converge
- ✅ Ask **different questions** than users would ask themselves

---

## The Golden Rules

### Rule 1: Questions, Not Commands

**❌ Bad** (prescriptive):
```python
"You should expand [[{note}]]. It's underdeveloped."
"Consider linking [[{note_a}]] to [[{note_b}]]."
"This note needs more connections."
```

**✅ Good** (provocative):
```python
"What if [[{note}]]'s brevity is intentional—a hinge concept that gains power from compression?"
"What if [[{note_a}]] and [[{note_b}]] were connected? What would emerge?"
"[[{note}]] has few links. Self-contained island or overlooked hub?"
```

**Key difference**: Good geists raise possibilities; bad geists give instructions.

---

### Rule 2: Speculative, Not Certain

**❌ Bad** (judgmental):
```python
"[[{note}]] is wrong."
"This connection doesn't make sense."
"You've made an error in [[{note}]]."
```

**✅ Good** (speculative):
```python
"What if [[{note}]] is only half the story?"
"[[{note_a}]] and [[{note_b}]] seem to contradict each other—what gives?"
"I think you're lying about your claim in [[{note}]]..." (playful provocation)
```

**Key words**: Use "might", "could", "what if", "perhaps" - never "must", "should", "needs to".

---

### Rule 3: Vault-Specific, Not Generic

**❌ Bad** (could apply to any vault):
```python
f"Why is {title}?"  # Generic question anyone would ask
f"How does {title} work?"  # Too obvious
"What if you thought about creativity?"  # Not grounded in vault
```

**✅ Good** (uses actual vault relationships):
```python
"[[{note_a}]] and [[{note_b}]] are semantically similar (0.87) despite no links. Same pattern, different scale?"
"[[{note}]] has been interpreted differently across your last 5 sessions—meaning unsettled?"
"Your Q2 notes cluster around [[Flow]], but Q4 notes cluster around [[Structure]]. Different seasons?"
```

**Key difference**: Reference specific notes, relationships, and patterns in the user's actual vault.

---

### Rule 4: Multiple Interpretations

**❌ Bad** (only one answer):
```python
"[[{note}]] is too short. You should expand it."  # One obvious action
```

**✅ Good** (many possible responses):
```python
"[[{note}]] has only 47 words but 8 backlinks. What if its brevity is intentional? Or is it waiting to emerge?"
# Could interpret as: 1) intentionally minimal, 2) needs expansion, 3) serves as connector, etc.
```

**Key difference**: Good questions open up thinking; bad questions narrow it down.

---

## Writing Patterns That Work

### Pattern 1: "What if" Questions
The most reliable pattern for provocative suggestions.

```python
"What if [[{note_a}]] and [[{note_b}]] were connected?"
"What if you zoomed in on [[{abstract_note}]]?"
"What if [[{note}]]'s contradictions are actually revealing something?"
```

### Pattern 2: Contrasting Observations
Point out patterns and let users interpret them.

```python
"[[{note}]] has high link density (0.15), while [[{other}]] has low density (0.02).
Connector vs. island?"
```

### Pattern 3: Temporal Awareness
Track changes over time without prescribing action.

```python
"Your understanding of [[{note}]] shifted between sessions,
even though you haven't edited it in 127 days. What changed?"
```

### Pattern 4: Provocative Framing
Use playful or challenging framing to spark engagement.

```python
"I think you're lying about your claim in [[{note}]] because..." (Columbo-style)
"What would the opposite of [[{note}]] look like?"
"Who would disagree with [[{note}]]?"
```

### Pattern 5: Either/Or Questions
Offer contrasting interpretations.

```python
"[[{note}]] is brief but referenced often. Hinge concept or placeholder?"
"Current preoccupation or emerging theme?"
"Deep focus or narrowing perspective?"
```

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Anti-Pattern 1: The Todo List
```python
# ❌ Don't turn geists into task managers
"You should expand [[{note}]]."
"Consider adding more links."
"This needs revision."
```

**Fix**: Ask what the current state reveals, don't prescribe changes.

---

### Anti-Pattern 2: The Linter
```python
# ❌ Don't give code-review style feedback
"[[{note}]] has too many links. Consider focusing on key connections."
"This note is too short for its importance."
"Poor link density detected."
```

**Fix**: Describe patterns and ask what they mean, don't judge them.

---

### Anti-Pattern 3: The Generic Template
```python
# ❌ Don't ask questions anyone would ask
f"Why is {title}?"  # Too obvious
f"How does {title} work?"  # Too generic
f"What is {title} about?"  # Not provocative
```

**Fix**: Use vault relationships to generate unexpected questions.

---

### Anti-Pattern 4: The Instruction Manual
```python
# ❌ Don't explain or educate
"Questions invite exploration where statements invite acceptance."
"Linking notes helps create connections."
"Writing regularly improves thinking."
```

**Fix**: Show, don't tell. Let the suggestion itself embody the principle.

---

## The "Would You Ask This Yourself?" Test

Before finalizing a geist, ask:

1. **Would I naturally think to ask this question?**
   - If yes → too generic, make it more specific/unexpected
   - If no → good, it's divergent

2. **Does this tell me what to do, or make me think?**
   - If "what to do" → too prescriptive, reframe as question
   - If "make me think" → good, it's provocative

3. **Could this apply to any vault, or is it specific to mine?**
   - If "any vault" → add specific note references
   - If "specific" → good, it's grounded

4. **Does this have one obvious answer, or multiple interpretations?**
   - If "one answer" → open it up with alternatives
   - If "multiple" → good, it's divergent

---

## Gold Standard Examples

Study these geists for excellent patterns:

### Columbo (Provocative Challenger)
```python
"I think you're lying about your claim in [[{note.title}]]
because [[{other.title}]] argues something that seems to contradict it"
```
**Why it's gold**: Playful, specific, catches user in contradictions they wouldn't notice.

---

### Session Drift (Metacognitive Mirror)
```python
"Your understanding of [[{note}]] shifted significantly between sessions.
What changed in how you're reading it?"
```
**Why it's gold**: Questions interpretation, not content. Reveals temporal evolution.

---

### Scale Shifter (Perspective Transformer)
```python
"[[{note}]] operates at high abstraction. What if you zoomed in?
[[{example}]] might be a more concrete instance."
```
**Why it's gold**: Suggests perspective shift, uses "might", connects specific notes.

---

### Assumption Challenger (Socratic Questioner)
```python
"[[{note}]] makes claims that seem certain,
but [[{other}]] expresses uncertainty.
What assumptions underlie the certainty?"
```
**Why it's gold**: Points out pattern, asks "what" not "you should".

---

## Practical Checklist

Before committing your geist, verify:

- [ ] Uses "what if" or question framing (not directives)
- [ ] Employs speculative language: "might", "could", "perhaps"
- [ ] References specific vault notes (not abstract concepts)
- [ ] Asks questions with multiple possible interpretations
- [ ] Provokes thinking rather than prescribing action
- [ ] Would surprise the user (not obvious questions)
- [ ] No directive verbs: "should", "consider", "must", "need to"
- [ ] No value judgments: "too many", "not enough", "wrong"
- [ ] Tone is playful or curious (not authoritative)

---

## Writing Process

### 1. Start With the Pattern
First, identify what your geist detects:
- Contradictions between notes?
- Temporal changes in understanding?
- Structural patterns in the graph?
- Semantic relationships?

### 2. Gather Vault Context
Collect specific information:
- Note titles, not just abstract categories
- Actual relationships (similarity scores, link counts, etc.)
- Temporal data (days since modified, session changes)

### 3. Draft Multiple Framings
Try different approaches:
```python
# Version 1: Direct question
"What if [[{note_a}]] and [[{note_b}]] contradict each other?"

# Version 2: Provocative framing
"I think you're lying about [[{note_a}]] because [[{note_b}]]..."

# Version 3: Either/or
"[[{note_a}]] and [[{note_b}]] seem opposed. Contradiction or complementary?"
```

### 4. Apply the "Would I Ask This?" Test
Pick the version that:
- You wouldn't naturally think of
- Makes you curious rather than obligated
- Opens up rather than narrows down

### 5. Remove Prescriptive Language
Edit out:
- "you should", "consider", "must"
- "worth doing", "needs", "requires"
- "too much", "not enough"

Replace with:
- "what if", "might", "could"
- Questions, not statements
- Observations, not judgments

---

## Language Reference

### ✅ Use These
- "What if..."
- "might", "could", "perhaps"
- "seems", "appears"
- "?" (questions)
- "or" (alternatives)
- Specific note titles: [[{note}]]
- Concrete numbers: "5 links", "127 days"

### ❌ Avoid These
- "you should", "consider"
- "must", "need to", "have to"
- "too much", "not enough"
- "worth", "important", "critical"
- "." (declarative statements)
- Generic abstractions: "creativity", "learning"
- Commands: "expand", "link", "revise"

---

## Examples: Before & After

### Example 1: Stub Expander

**❌ Before** (prescriptive):
```python
"What if you expanded [[{note}]]? It's only {words} words but has {links} connections.
This stub might be worth developing."
```

**✅ After** (provocative):
```python
"[[{note}]] has only {words} words but {links} notes reference it.
What if its brevity is intentional—a hinge gaining power from compression?
Or is it a placeholder waiting to emerge?"
```

---

### Example 2: Link Density

**❌ Before** (linter-style):
```python
"[[{note}]] has too many links ({count} in {words} words).
Consider focusing on key connections."
```

**✅ After** (observational):
```python
"[[{note}]] has high link density ({density:.2f} per 100 words).
Is this a rhizome concept spreading through your vault?
Or is the density obscuring which connections actually matter?"
```

---

### Example 3: Question Generator

**❌ Before** (generic template):
```python
f"What if you reframed [[{title}]] as a question: 'Why is {title}?'"
```

**✅ After** (vault-specific):
```python
"[[{question_note}]] has been sitting as a question for {days} days.
What if [[{similar[0]}]], [[{similar[1]}]], and [[{similar[2]}]]
are actually partial answers you already have?"
```

---

## Advanced Techniques

### Technique 1: Columbo Mode
Frame findings as detective work, using playful confrontation:
```python
"I think you're lying about..."
"Something doesn't add up in..."
"You claim X in [[note_a]], but [[note_b]] suggests Y..."
```

### Technique 2: Temporal Framing
Emphasize change over time:
```python
"Your understanding of X shifted between sessions..."
"You wrote about Y in Q2, but Z in Q4..."
"X has been sitting unchanged for N days, but..."
```

### Technique 3: Scale Shifting
Suggest zooming in/out:
```python
"What if you zoomed in on [[abstract_note]]?"
"What if you zoomed out from [[specific_note]]?"
"X is concrete; what's the abstract pattern?"
```

### Technique 4: Dialectical Framing
Use thesis/antithesis/synthesis:
```python
"X and Y seem opposed. What would their synthesis be?"
"What's the antithesis of X?"
"X challenges Y—what reconciles them?"
```

---

## Common Questions

### Q: Can I ever use directive language?
**A**: Rarely. If you do, it should be playful/provocative, not authoritative:
- ✅ "I think you're lying about..." (playful challenge)
- ❌ "You should link these notes" (authoritative command)

### Q: What if my geist genuinely finds an error?
**A**: Frame it as a question, not a correction:
- ❌ "[[note]] has an error"
- ✅ "[[note_a]] and [[note_b]] seem to contradict—what gives?"

### Q: Can I suggest creating a new note?
**A**: Yes, but make it speculative:
- ❌ "You should create a synthesis note"
- ✅ "What would a synthesis between X and Y look like?"

### Q: How specific should I be?
**A**: Very. Reference actual note titles, specific numbers, concrete relationships.

### Q: What about Tracery geists?
**A**: Same principles apply. Use vault functions ($vault.sample_notes, etc.) to ground abstract templates in specific vault content.

## Getting Feedback

Test your geist by asking others:
1. **Does this feel like advice or a question?**
2. **Would you naturally think to ask this yourself?**
3. **Does this make you curious or obligated?**
4. **Is this specific to a vault or generic?**

If answers are "advice", "yes I'd ask this", "obligated", "generic" → revise.

## Final Wisdom

> "The owl of Minerva spreads its wings only with the falling of the dusk." — Hegel

Like Hegel's owl, geists work retrospectively—finding patterns and questions in knowledge already accumulated. They are **spirits in a factory of thought**, not managers of a to-do list.

Your geist should ask: **"What if?"** not **"You should."**

It should be a **muse**, not an **oracle**.

Most importantly, it should ask **different questions than users would ask themselves**—because that's the whole point of a divergence engine.

**Happy geist writing!**
