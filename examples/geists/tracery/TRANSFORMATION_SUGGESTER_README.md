# Transformation Suggester - Modifier Showcase Geist

## Overview

`transformation_suggester` is a comprehensive showcase geist that demonstrates all five Tracery modifiers implemented in GeistFabrik:

- `.capitalize` - Capitalize first letter
- `.capitalizeAll` - Capitalize all words
- `.s` - Pluralization (with irregulars)
- `.ed` - Past tense (with irregulars)
- `.a` - Article selection

This geist generates creative suggestions for transforming and recontextualizing notes using natural, grammatically correct language.

## Modifiers Demonstrated

### 1. `.capitalize` - First Letter Capitalization

```yaml
#opening.capitalize# you #action.ed# [[#note#]]
```

**Output Examples:**
- "What if you explored [[Ideas]]"
- "Imagine you approached [[Project Planning]]"
- "Consider you viewed [[Strategy]]"

**Usage:** Start sentences with proper capitalization.

---

### 2. `.capitalizeAll` - Title Case

```yaml
#concept.capitalizeAll#: [[#note#]] has #relationship.s#
```

**Output Examples:**
- "Hidden Pattern: [[Ideas]] has connections with other notes"
- "Emerging Theme: [[Strategy]] has resonances with five concepts"
- "Key Insight: [[Planning]] has tensions with two ideas"

**Usage:** Create section headers or emphasis with proper title case.

---

### 3. `.s` - Pluralization

**Regular Plurals:**
```yaml
#element.s# → "connections", "assumptions", "patterns"
#item.s# → "notes", "ideas", "concepts"
```

**Irregular Plurals:**
```yaml
person → people
child → children
man → men
woman → women
```

**Special Rules:**
- "city" → "cities" (consonant + y)
- "box" → "boxes" (ends in x)
- "church" → "churches" (ends in ch)

**Output Examples:**
- "it has three connections"
- "five assumptions"
- "seven patterns"

---

### 4. `.ed` - Past Tense

**Regular Past Tense:**
```yaml
#action.ed# → "viewed", "approached", "explored"
```

**Irregular Verbs:**
```yaml
write → wrote
think → thought
make → made
go → went
find → found
build → built
```

**Special Rules:**
- "create" → "created" (ends in e)
- "try" → "tried" (consonant + y)

**Output Examples:**
- "Last year, you wrote [[Ideas]]"
- "Recently, you thought about [[Strategy]]"
- "Three months ago, you made [[Framework]]"

---

### 5. `.a` - Article Selection

**Consonant Start:**
```yaml
"garden" → "a garden"
"blueprint" → "a blueprint"
"map" → "a map"
```

**Vowel Start:**
```yaml
"organism" → "an organism"
"experiment" → "an experiment"
"archive" → "an archive"
```

**Special Cases:**
```yaml
"hour" → "an hour" (silent h)
"university" → "a university" (yoo sound)
```

**Output Examples:**
- "treat [[Notes]] as an experiment"
- "apply a first principle approach"
- "discover an understanding"

---

### 6. Modifier Chaining

Combine multiple modifiers by chaining with dots:

```yaml
#pattern.s.capitalize# → "Assumptions", "Connections", "Gaps"
#verb.ed.capitalize# → "Explored", "Created", "Thought"
```

**Output Examples:**
- "Do the Assumptions in [[Ideas]] reveal an opportunity?"
- "Could the Connections in [[Strategy]] reveal a truth?"

---

## Example Outputs

### Example 1: Complex Chaining
```yaml
origin: "#starter.capitalize# [[#note#]] #transform_verb.ed# into #number# #new_form.s#"
```

**Output:**
- "Imagine if [[Project Planning]] evolved into three insights"
- "What if [[Strategy]] grew into five perspectives"
- "Consider how [[Ideas]] split into seven questions"

---

### Example 2: Article + Metaphor
```yaml
origin: "#opening.capitalize# you #action.ed# [[#note#]] like #metaphor.a#"
```

**Output:**
- "What if you treated [[Ideas]] like an organism"
- "Imagine you approached [[Strategy]] like a garden"
- "Consider you viewed [[Planning]] like an ecosystem"

---

### Example 3: Plurals + Count
```yaml
origin: "#observation.capitalize# about [[#note#]]: it has #count# #element.s#"
```

**Output:**
- "Interesting about [[Ideas]]: it has three connections"
- "Curious about [[Strategy]]: it has five assumptions"
- "Notable about [[Planning]]: it has seven questions"

---

### Example 4: All Modifiers Together
```yaml
origin: "treat [[#note#]] as #treatment.a#, apply #method.a#, discover #outcome.a#"
```

**Output:**
- "treat [[Ideas]] as an experiment, apply a first principle approach, discover an insight"
- "treat [[Strategy]] as a hypothesis, apply an alternative lens, discover a revelation"

## Configuration

The geist is configured to generate **3 suggestions per invocation**:

```yaml
count: 3
```

You can modify this in the YAML file to generate more or fewer suggestions.

---

## Grammar Structure

The geist uses **8 origin templates**, each showcasing different modifier combinations:

1. **Capitalize + Past Tense + Article**: `#opening.capitalize# you #action.ed# [[#note#]] like #metaphor.a#`
2. **Capitalize + Plurals**: `#observation.capitalize# about [[#note#]]: it has #count# #element.s#`
3. **Capitalize All**: `#concept.capitalizeAll#: [[#note#]] #relationship.s# with #num# other #item.s#`
4. **Multiple Articles**: `[[#note#]] could be #descriptor.a#, not #other_descriptor.a#`
5. **Plural Chaining**: `#question_start.capitalize# the #pattern.s.capitalize# in [[#note#]] reveal #insight.a#?`
6. **Past Tense + Capitalize**: `#time_phrase.capitalize#, you #verb.ed# [[#note#]]. #prompt.capitalize# now`
7. **All Modifiers**: `#starter.capitalize# [[#note#]] #transform_verb.ed# into #number# #new_form.s#. #question.capitalize#`
8. **Triple Articles**: `treat [[#note#]] as #treatment.a#, apply #method.a#, discover #outcome.a#`

## Tips for Creating Your Own Modifier-Rich Geists

1. **Use base forms**: Store verbs in present tense, nouns in singular
   ```yaml
   verb: ["explore", "create"]  # ✓ Good
   verb: ["explored", "created"]  # ✗ Bad - hardcoded
   ```

2. **Test vowel/consonant variety**: Include both for article testing
   ```yaml
   noun: ["owl", "cat", "hour", "university"]  # Mix of patterns
   ```

3. **Include irregulars**: Test irregular plurals and verbs
   ```yaml
   noun: ["person", "child"]  # Tests irregular plurals
   verb: ["go", "think"]      # Tests irregular past tense
   ```

4. **Chain thoughtfully**: Order matters in chaining
   ```yaml
   #word.s.capitalize#  # ✓ "Ideas" (plural then capitalize)
   #word.capitalize.s#  # ✗ "Ideas" (might capitalize wrong letter)
   ```

5. **Capitalize questions**: Use .capitalize for sentence starts
   ```yaml
   origin: "#question.capitalize# you try this?"
   ```

## Performance

- **Load time**: < 50ms
- **Generation time**: < 10ms per suggestion
- **Deterministic**: Same seed + vault = same output
