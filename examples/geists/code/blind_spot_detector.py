"""Blind Spot Detector - Identify semantic gaps in your vault.

This geist finds what your vault ISN'T about by comparing recent notes
to their semantic opposites. If you've been writing about certain topics
but their contrarian perspectives are sparse or old, it suggests blind spots
in your thinking.
